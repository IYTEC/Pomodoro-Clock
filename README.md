#   BUILD A POMODORO CLOCK


##  Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNyxXR/).


#   RULES
1.  Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
2.  Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
3.  I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
4.  I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
5.  I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
